**Project Title**: ASP.NET MVC Point of Sale System 

**Description**:

Talabat is a comprehensive web application designed to facilitate the management of sales and inventory for a business. This project leverages the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, offering a well-structured, scalable, and maintainable solution. Key features include a user-friendly dashboard, cashier authentication, and role-based authorization using ASP.NET Identity, as well as CRUD operations for managing products, sales, and cashiers.

**Key Components**:

1. **Dashboard**: The project features a dynamic and visually appealing dashboard that provides at-a-glance insights into the business's key performance indicators. Cashiers, upon logging in, are greeted with widgets displaying sales trends, inventory status, and other relevant data.

2. **Cashier Authentication and Authorization**: The project integrates ASP.NET Identity for cashier authentication and role-based authorization. Cashiers can register, log in, and reset their passwords securely. Additionally, role-based authorization ensures that only authorized cashiers can access specific parts of the application. Common roles may include Admin, Salesperson, and Manager, each with different levels of access.

3. **Product Management (CRUD)**: The application allows cashiers with appropriate permissions to manage products. This includes creating new products, updating existing ones, viewing detailed product information, and deleting products that are no longer in stock. Product data typically includes product names, descriptions, prices, and quantities.

4. **Sales Management (CRUD)**: Cashiers can create and manage sales transactions within the system. They can add products to a cart, specify the quantity sold, and complete the transaction. The system then updates the inventory accordingly. Sales transactions can be reviewed, edited, or deleted, and detailed sales reports can be generated.

5. **Cashier Management (CRUD)**: Administrators have the ability to manage cashier accounts. This includes creating new accounts, updating cashier details, assigning roles, and deactivating or deleting accounts when necessary. Cashier roles determine the level of access to different sections of the application.

**Technologies Used**:

- **ASP.NET MVC**: The web framework that enables the creation of a structured and maintainable application.
- **Entity Framework**: Used for data access and database management.
- **ASP.NET Identity**: For cashier authentication, authorization, and role management.
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: Used for front-end development and user interface design.
